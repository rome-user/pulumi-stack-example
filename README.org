#+TITLE: stack-readme-java translation

This example demonstrates how to use Pulumi Java SDK directly in Clojure. To run
this example, you will need:

- Java 11 or later
- Leiningen

* Running example

** Caveat

Pulumi does not support Leiningen natively. With that said, we have generated a
pom.xml file using =lein pom= and used the exec-plugin to invoke leiningen with
the following steps: clean, compile, uberjar. Lastly, there is a java execution
goal that runs the class =stackreadme.app=.

Note: it is theoretically to use =:pom-plugins= to configure plugins rather than
write the XML by hand. In the interest of time, I wrote by hand.

** Actually running example

Run =lein deps= to fetch dependencies then =pulumi up=.
